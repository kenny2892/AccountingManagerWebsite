# Accounting Manager Website
This is a work in progress (made this over the last 2 days) C# ASP.NET 7 personal website to view and edit my accounting data. All data is stored in a local SQLite file and accessed via Entity Framework Core.

<ins>**This project is designed to be run on my local network as a learning experience, so security and efficency are not a priority.**</ins>

## Current Features
- Standard CRUD operations.
- The table loads transactions in as you scroll down the page.
